( http : / / www . cs . ucy . ac . cy / sac99 . html ) sac ' 99 : ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ over the past thirteen years , the acm symposium on applied computing ( sac ) has become a primary forum for applied computer scientists and application developers from around the world to interact and present their work . sac ' 99 is sponsored by the acm special interest groups sigada , sigapp , sigbio , and sigcue . authors are invited to contribute original papers in all areas of experimental computing and application development for the technical sessions . there will be a number of special tracks on such issues as programming languages , parallel and distributed computing , mobile and scientific computing , internet and the www , etc . coordination models , languages and applications track : ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ a special track on coordination models , languages and applications will be held at sac ' 99 . the term \\\" coordination \\\" here is used in a rather broad sense covering traditional models and languages ( e . g . ones based on the shared dataspace and cham metaphors ) but also other related formalisms such as configuration and architectural description frameworks , systems modeling abstractions and languages , programming skeletons , etc . this track on coordination is held for the second time as part of acm sac 's events . the cfp for the acm sac ' 98 track attracted 33 submissions from 18 countries ; 8 of those submissions were accepted as regular papers and 4 more as short papers . major topics of interest include but are not limited to the following : * novel models , languages , programming and implementation techniques . * relationship with other computational models such as object oriented , declarative ( functional , logic , constraint ) programming or extensions of them with coordination capabilities . * applications ( especially where the industry is involved ) . * theoretical aspects ( semantics , reasoning , verification ) . * software architectures and software engineering techniques . * middleware platforms ( e . g . corba ) . * all aspects related to the modeling of information systems ( groupware , internet and the web , workflow management , cscw ) . track program chair : ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ george a . papadopoulos department of computer science university of cyprus 75 kallipoleos str . , p . o . b . 537 cy-1678 , nicosia , cyprus e - mail : george @ cs . ucy . ac . cy tel : + 357 2 338705 / 06 , fax : + 357 2 339062 guidelines for submission : ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ original papers from the above-mentioned or other related areas will be considered . this includes three categories of submissions : 1 ) original and unpublished research ;
